This is a web radio player. Actually it plays all the songs located in the mp3 folder in a random order each time. 

You can see its functionalities here: 
radio.gotsopoulos.com

It also supports a primitive way of commenting and a file manager to upload new mp3s

Due to some bugs of the DewPlayer I have included a second player in case it is needed which is inside the beta1 folder and it does exactly the same things.

Enjoy!
